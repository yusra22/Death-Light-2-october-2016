Mike: What the hell was that !!?
That creature ... it stalked towards me in my moment of terror and I froze, unable to peel my eyes away from its ghastly towering features. 
Its face was sunken in, eyes unfocused. Its mouth twitched and drooled as if craving for something, anything, me.
Mike: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Mike: ARHHHH!! RUNNNNN !!!!
